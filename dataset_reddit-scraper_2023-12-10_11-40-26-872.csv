Having someone who knew the person well in childhood and was an adult at that time - like a parent - be able to speak to how the person acted during childhood is invaluable because they would have had first hand knowledge - as an adult - of that person’s external symptoms. A 20 year old (or even a 25 or 35 or 40 year old) may not have that great of a recollection of their possible symptoms during childhood, because they were a young child at the time. Understand?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond input from a parent, it’s also helpful for a doctor to get information from childhood records such as report cards and teacher comments. For example, if a child did well in school but teachers regularly noted on report cards or in other notes that the person “frequently interrupted others” or “couldn’t sit still during class,” those are strong indicators that the person did experience adhd symptoms in childhood.&lt;/p&gt;

Also from what you describe, it doesn't seem as though your PCP is coming from a disingenuous place. Not sure of their exact reason of wanting to try different meds. If you are supposed to go off of them completely, or potentially add on a non-stimulant. 

If you're not struggling with your current meds and feel as though your benefiting from them, I would definitely advocate for staying on them or at least getting a monthly supply of your medication prescribed as currently tailored until you can get a psychiatrist to take over for your mental health medication management. Tell them about your concerns. Tell them how much you feel that the medication has been benefiting you in the long term, that you think there could be consequences with the foundation you've built so far if you were to just go off of them in pursuit of a potential second option that might not be necessary. 

Non-stimulants are not inherently bad options, but they aren't typically used as first line treatment unless someone doesn't tolerate medication well or has a different circumstance in which they would take the medication before stimulants. They aren't as effective on their own stimulants, even though they are typically more effective than placebos. alone. They can be used as a monotherapy or as an add on to stimulants, and a few different options do exist outside of strattera(which is an snri). 

You have alpha 2 adrenergic agonist, like guanfacine and clonidine. 

There's also viloxazine, which is an snri like strattera. Everyone's reaction to a medication and it's formulation varies.

As far as worrying about dependence, you're taking your medicine as prescribed and it's helping you. You have ADHD and while every medication has a risk, your depending on it to help manage your symptoms that affect you day-to-day life within clinical means. 

As long as you're not abusing it, not inclined to do so, taking it as prescribed and communicating adequately with your prescriber, dependence is not the biggest concern in the long term. It's not equal to addiction, but you can always bring up that concern regarding your family history if you feel inclined to do so. Addiction is a truly serious disease, and this isn't to downplay it. From what you've communicated, you are responsible with your medication and more so concerned over managing your life with the medication within safe means.

Having properly managed ADHD is a better preventative measure in regards to reducing potential substance abuse, then going off of a medication because it's a controlled substance and has that potential risk when not taken as it was designed. Taking a form of amphetamine or methylphenidate is highly stigmatized by people who typically don't have ADHD. Wouldn't be surprised if that seems stigma was given towards those with narcolepsy, who take stimulants. 

 They are not perfect drug classes. They have their drawbacks, but medications within those drug classes I have helped many people survive when tailored correctly. As far as the ongoing shortages, it does suck. However, that shouldn't be factored into weaning or disconnecting a patients medication if it's working for them well with minimal side effects. 

That falls on pharmaceutical companies for not properly manufacturing within their given allotments until a shortage occurs, and on both the manufacturers and regulators who aren't urgently concerned with making sure those who need their stimulant medication are having the shortage issues addressed.

Some prescribers are prescribing alternatives are similar and potentially in stock more readily, and sometimes it's a match between having to wait for a back order to lift or trying to go to multiple local pharmacies. The shortages are sporadic, but eventually they'll be less prominent. Needing treatment is needing treatment. 

People taking recreational doses goes above what you've been prescribed, and it's going outside of that therapeutic dosage window with a lack of regard for why the medication exist medically that really lands you in trouble. 

Lifestyle changes doesn't always help dramatically, because ADHD is physiological. We can take steps I'm making our environments more accommodating as we should, but impairments from ADHD come from within the brain at the end of the day and medication helps with the functionality of the brain. There's only so much specific solutions can do, and you want to make sure that those solutions are practical, safe, and beneficial.","1702182685","false","kcq9hj0","false","salbrown","t2_2ohazu7d","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you I really appreciate all of this info.

Rejection sensitivity dysphoria has not been the subject of any credible peer-reviewed scientific research, nor is it listed in the top two psychiatric diagnostic manuals, the DSM or the ICD. It has been propagated solely through blogs and the internet by William Dodson, who coined the term in the context of ADHD. Dodson's explanation of these experiences and claims about how to treat it all warrant healthy skepticism.

Here are some scientific articles on ADHD and rejection:

* [Rejection sensitivity and disruption of attention by social threat cues](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2771869/)
* [Justice and rejection sensitivity in children and adolescents with ADHD symptoms](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24878677/)
* [Rejection sensitivity and social outcomes of young adult men with ADHD](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17242422/)

Although r/ADHD's rules strictly disallow discussion of other 'popular science' (aka unproven hypotheses), we find that many, many people identify with the concept of RSD, and we have **not** removed this post. We do not want to minimise or downplay your feelings, and many people use RSD as a shorthand for this shared experience of struggling with emotions. 

However, please consider using the terms 'rejection sensitivity' and 'emotional dysregulation' instead.

Was enough for me and my family to finally acknowledge that I have ADHD as I was very high functioning most of my life (at least when it came to grades). 

I have been on 20-30 mg of adderall for 3 years now and it has been life changing for me. I didn’t even know how much I was struggling until after I started medication, it was like realizing I had been living my entire life on hard mode. I stopped binge eating, got my rejection sensitivity way more under control, and finally managed to keep myself to a routine. Literally feel like every aspect of my life has improved on meds. 

My doctor (the same one that diagnosed me and initially prescribed me Adderall) has said she wants me to try non-stimulant alternatives. While I don’t feel totally against experimenting with my meds, I have tried things like Strattera and it did nothing noticeable and I experienced a lot of side effects. I completely understand where she’s coming from, especially with the shortages, and I also feel a bit weird about being ‘dependent’ on an amphetamine to function. Especially because addiction runs in my family. But I’ve never found lifestyle changes that work like my meds work.

Was enough for me and my family to finally acknowledge that I have ADHD as I was very high functioning most of my life (at least when it came to grades). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been on 20-30 mg of adderall for 3 years now and it has been life changing for me. I didn’t even know how much I was struggling until after I started medication, it was like realizing I had been living my entire life on hard mode. I stopped binge eating, got my rejection sensitivity way more under control, and finally managed to keep myself to a routine. Literally feel like every aspect of my life has improved on meds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My doctor (the same one that diagnosed me and initially prescribed me Adderall) has said she wants me to try non-stimulant alternatives. While I don’t feel totally against experimenting with my meds, I have tried things like Strattera and it did nothing noticeable and I experienced a lot of side effects. I completely understand where she’s coming from, especially with the shortages, and I also feel a bit weird about being ‘dependent’ on an amphetamine to function. Especially because addiction runs in my family. But I’ve never found lifestyle changes that work like my meds work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;26 years old with a total of 3 kids, (6f, 3f, 2f) but the two younger ones live with me and my SO, (31m) aka, their dad. I was diagnosed at 20, while SO was when he was a teenager. I&amp;#39;m medicated, he&amp;#39;s not, so I think that makes a huge difference. I&amp;#39;m also trying to start the process of being screened for autism, but it&amp;#39;s been difficult. anyways, the triggers you stated are so real in our lives, it&amp;#39;s insane. when I had my now 3 year old, I didn&amp;#39;t think I could do it. I was convinced I&amp;#39;d be exactly like my parents (not the greatest, for lack of better terms) and I was so scared of passing down my generational trauma. long story short, they gave me a reason to live and to heal. they&amp;#39;re my motivation to not only become the parent they need, but to also become the person I need for myself and my SO. parenting is by far the scariest, most heart wrenching thing I&amp;#39;ve ever endured, or will probably ever go through. throughout these past few years, because of these triggers, I have found ways to cope in a healthy way and have gained the knowledge to do. being a parent is always going to be hard, but man... seeing them grow and mature, hearing those laughs and the million, &amp;quot;i love you&amp;#39;s&amp;quot; every day makes every tear that has been shed, so absolutely worth it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will say that being a parent, at least a slightly happy one, is most certainly not for everyone. I remember reading somewhere a quote that resonates with me every day: &amp;quot;every child deserves a parent, but not every parent deserves a child.&amp;quot; it is something that needs to be talked about openly, to get a better understanding of whether that is the life you want. &lt;/p&gt;

Is NOT a diagnosis of your intelligence. Please, when that negative and harsh inner critic whispers in your ear, remember that you are not stupid. It takes us longer and via different routes to learn. I made it through school without meds and goodness knows I spend hours with my self-made study guides, pacing and self-teaching on a dry erase board at the library. I became “besties” with my teachers/professors. I would go to them once a week with my questions, on top of tutors. I ran constantly to help my adhd (didn’t realize at that time that was what I was doing). You. Can. Find. Your. Rhythm. Truly. And I’m confident you will be successful. ADHD is not a negative. We see the world differently, which helps us to create solutions to problems majority of the world hasn’t figured out. We are creative. We are empathetic. We become insanely knowledgeable in things we like (hello hyperfocus for the win!). Please don’t give up. Asking for help isn’t stupid.

One bit of culture differences that positively impacted me was learning that the East is so successful with business and science due to their collaboration. They met and if someone is struggling, others jump in. It is everyone contributing what they know. So, asking for “help” isn’t weakness. It’s smart. It is letting someone who “gets it” or loves it teach back, helping to increase your understanding.

Don’t give up. You are gifted with a different view of the world from most others, meaning, you are valuable to see and solve and change things that others don’t see or can’t fix. You have intelligence. ADHD is not an intellectual diagnosis. It is a wiring diagnosis, where the norepinephrine and dopamine are not regulating the way they were intended. So meds and behavioral modifications and diet/nutrition and social engagement all help us be our best.

For example after 10 years of quitting college. I decided to go back . During my 1st year It wasn’t easy to focus in class or do the homeworks. I kept falling classes until I figured something out.
1) Focus is a result of motivation. You will get enough energy to focus if you are motivated enough (even with adhd)
2) for motivation you need a goal.
In my case I wanted to be a programmer.
2.1)I always been a fan of technology
2.2) it makes good money= stability = buy my own house to start a family … etc
3)For that I need to develop some programming skills, college diploma to get this skills recognized 

3.1) to get my diploma I have to pass my classes 
3.2) to develop my skills I have to do my  readings and my homework

So when I m not in a mood to do my homework or feel unmotivated because there is a lot of reading or work or when I feel anxious about being with students half my age and I don’t want to go to class so they can laugh at me 

I think of my ultimate goal and what I have to do to get there.

Alcohol/drug addiction

Hun, you’re not stupid. A lot of us feel that way at times, when our brains let us down. But it doesn’t make it true. It sounds like you’ve been through a lot and people in your life have let you down. You haven’t had the support or opportunities you deserved. But your life isn’t wasted — just you going to your classes proves that. And I doubt people there think you’re stupid. The other students didn’t finish their educations in the traditional way, either. But everybody is showing up and trying. And the teachers have chosen to work with y’all — so they shouldn’t think you’re stupid either; they probably know you just did a couple of your life steps in a different order from most people.

Education and intelligence are not the same thing. My great-grandfather was an incredibly smart man who only went to school for a few years. Most people alive today aren’t that far removed from our ancestors who would’ve had little, if any, formal schooling. Education was optional in the US until 1930. It didn’t make our grandparents and their parents (and all the generations before them) stupid. It made them people who did the best they could with the opportunities they were given. Just like you are.

I think a lot about this Maya Angelou quote: “I did then what I knew how to do. Now that I know better, I do better.” It’s helped me forgive my past self for her mistakes. That past version of me was doing her best, even if she made a lot of mistakes and caused me a lot of problems in the present.

You’re doing your best, and that’s what matters. This is a great place to find strategies for managing your ADHD, too. You said you struggle to focus on anything at all — if you can give some examples, people will probably have some ideas that might help!

I know you can’t see it right now, but you deserve to be proud of yourself. You are in the process of overcoming your challenges and your past. And if you can’t be proud of yourself, then I’m proud of you. 🩷","1702181755","false","false","t3_18emcgh","t3_18emcgh",,,,,,,,,,,"2","t5_2qnwb","https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/18emcgh/i_feel_so_stupid/kcq7rkr/",,"t2_5hpayg79","I'm 40.

Everyone says life has to happen in a certain way. You're only supposed to do certain things at certain times or else you're considered a failure.

But that's not true!

You can accomplish any goals anytime.

Just because you're learning the same things other people did at a later date doesn't mean it's not an accomplishment, or that you're not smart. In the end you'll all have learned the same things, just walked different paths to get there.

I'm sure you already have a lot of knowledge and skills that other people haven't learned yet. If other people learned those things later in life, would that mean they're not as smart as you?

Learning is a struggle, but don't be so hard on yourself. Many people never go back to school at all. The fact that you made that choice is something to be proud of and I think that you're doing amazing! 

I relate a lot to this because I've been there in a way. I dropped out of community college and everyone made me feel like a failure. Looking back, if you'd ask me what I wish I could have done differently, I wish I'd ignored everyone and had fun learning. The pressure to keep up with everyone else destroyed me.

You get a life of constantly not living up to expectations, and if you get into a field where there's a lot of imposter syndrome anyway (like STEM) then you just end up believing that everyone suffers with it like you do (only like with many things, ADHD tends to cause a more severe version).

In my case, underperforming for years at work after being top of my class with a high GPA drove me to become a workaholic to try to make up for my low performance and slowness.  But that only made it even more impossible to manage the rest of my life, so I eventually burned out hard.  It certainly didn't help that it's a common thing in my generation to not feel good at ""adulting"", so like with imposter syndrome I figured I was normal.

I struggle every day. 

I sailed through PhD coursework and qualifying exams and comprehensive exams — the comps in my programme are famously brutal and people fail out of the programme — and defended my dissertation proposal and achieved PhD candidate status and am yet to hand in and defend my dissertation years later. 

I have published two articles which amount to two of my PhD chapters and am yet to hand in and defend my dissertation years later. 

I win awards, internationally, as a professional theatre director, outside of my academic position, but struggle to deal with the immense cognitive load and emotional crash when I close a season, and find even slightly careless theatre reviews that are praising my direction to be crushing. 

I had to sit through my yearly performance appraisal recently, which stresses me immeasurably every year, and finally brought in occupational safety and health at my university (who confidentially know my diagnosis) to handle some level of accommodations and understanding in the face of brutal workplace bullying and (obviously) unnecessary micromanagement. 

I suppose to others I look high achieving and probably confident verging on arrogant. In fact, I’m riddled with self-doubt and have co-morbid bipolar one with my ADHD. Simply holding onto my brain every day tires me and it burned me out this year, repeatedly.

Ivy League grads have an average IQ of 140. Which sounds impressive, but on average every high school graduating class in the country has at least two such people. 
    
It's only 1 in 250. Which means that you can be the smartest person not only in your graduating class, but in your whole entire school system, and then go on to have literally the lowest IQ of your entire graduating class at MIT or Caltech.
   
It's hard for me to wrap my head around. In my world, my perfect standardized test scores were impressive. At Ivy Leagues, everybody has perfect standardized test scores. They have graduating classes of around about 7,000. The average IQ there is 140. Their normal is our 1 in 250. Their 1 in 250 have an IQ of 180. Their 1 in 1000 have an IQ of 185. Our general population 1 in 1000 have an IQ of 145. A 180 IQ in the general population is 1 in 20 million. 185 is 1 in 100 million. 
      
So either you possess a truly dizzying intellect, or else you're not being challenged by particularly hard courses in particularly hard subjects at a particularly competitive school. 
      
I don't have any idea which is which. If you're coasting through your Ivy League classes while barely studying, then you must have an IQ of around 160, which occurs around 1 in every 30,000 people. That's pretty cool! I don't have a point or anything. I just think that's neat.
      
And if you're coasting through P-Chem at your state school, then that's still really cool, also.
      
I'm not quite that smart. My intellect alone only gets me so far. I can write a dazzling undergrad term paper overnight, but I can't pass P-Chem at all, let alone without studying. Because I can't study. I never learned how. I'm going back to school for that now.
    
It's a bit sad to think of where I could have been by now if I'd learned discipline and how to study a long time ago. Still, ADHD isn't my most disabling mental illness, or else I might be in your boat, able to manage classes despite those symptoms, even if everything else was still continually falling apart around me.

It’s also why my life is currently a mess from being unable to properly cope with it outside of an academic setting as an adult. I also feel angry about the potential I had of doing more with my intelligence had i been diagnosed earlier. I dropped out of college at 19 due to covid and things going online, for me it was impossible to do well with that going on especially being unmedicated back then. I still haven’t gone back and I feel angry looking back on how I could’ve handled a lot of situations like that better in my life had I been diagnosed earlier. But my intelligence is why I was able to mask it so well and fly under the radar.

Growing up I simply was a very good test taker and I can pick up on things very quick when it’s crunch time but otherwise my intelligence is kind of useless to me. I would barely ever do my homework but I would get 90-100% on tests while barely paying attention in class (maladaptive daydreaming, and then just skipping when I got older) so I was never failing my classes despite having shit attendance and having tons of zeros in homework/project categories. I would skate by with mostly Bs in the end, but it makes me mad that I could’ve excelled and gotten into a much better college then I did and life would be much different for me had I been diagnosed sooner. I got into an okay university and went for one year before dropping out. 

Then university somewhat reinforced my bad adhd habits. I still did great on exams despite barely showing up to my classes and now they were worth a bigger % of the grade. So I did better on paper in university but still had such bad habits that were kinda being rewarded. Once covid hit though it switched to the exams being worth less and more of a project/attendance emphasis since it’s easier to cheat from home. Executive dysfunction + online class = my grades tanking and me dropping out. I wanna go back eventually but I’m still picking up the pieces from the financial decisions I had to make as a result of dropping out so idk. Kind of why I’m a tad bitter still about not being diagnosed sooner, but I am medicated now and getting my life back on track. 

I really resonate with feeling like an imposter because people in school would be like “I had to study all night for this exam” and I would just show up and do the same or better than them. Or I would BS my way through essays the last minute and usually get an A while others would put in time and get a B. But if you’re still in university, I have to warn you and say you might be in for a rude awakening like I was about how bad your ADHD symptoms are when it comes to other adult responsibilities in the future. I live alone now and whew, BSing my way through school was certainly easier than managing all my current responsibilities w/adhd. My life quickly became a mess and it’s what pushed me to get a diagnosis.

Medicated, I wake up without a knot of dread in my stomach every morning. I see challenges in my day as challenges not world-ending catastrophes. 

Slept in and late for work and school today? Pre-meds that would have ruined my day and led to the kind of severe emotional dysregulation that would have me yelling at everyone, slamming doors, driving dangerously, and then apologizing later on. All of that to ""fix"" a ""catastrophe"" that's already happened. 

This ⬆️ same situation happened to me yesterday and the difference in reaction and cognitive processing is unbelievable. I realized that I must have accidentally hit ""off"" instead of ""snooze"". And instead of melting down, I calmly adjusted the day to fit the situation. 

I even had the self-awareness to think, I've had a bad cold, and I took some meds yesterday, they must have conked me out. 🤷‍♀️ It was an excellent day, even with a rough start.

I always compare myself now to myself before meds because I have made so much progress. I’ve had 2 back to back surgeries this month… and I am able to make JOKES about it.

I'm 24 and man, it was SO hard to discover that I could have really achieved my goals, as in school or daily life because i had to give them up against my will, and this feeling of extreme sadness didn't leave me until few weeks, had been there for solid 4 years.

It was this summer, now I have a proper medication with a professional following me since less than a month. And I feel so self-confident. Because I can achieve my goals at work (temporary one), everyone can have confidence towards me and can count on me. I don't feel out of place anymore, and we all have sympathy for each other. For daily life, I would say there are two thing:

- Daily tasks, and adulthood. 
I Can have all my papers done when it has to be. Saving me money for some, and a huge amount of anxiety overall. For example, I have to change my identity papers because I'm transgender: It took me 3 weeks to get an appointment and all of my folder done, in reality I had to do it for 3 years now. It still get me in trouble today, because people think it's not me on my papers.
I can clean. Before I had to just cry alone in my apartment because it was so dirty and shameful. Now I don't even think about it, i just do the chores. It helps me to be in a better mindset. Clean Space = positive mind. It also saves me money because the dishes don't stay for months (3 or 4) in the sink while I ignored it. I don't use take away anymore.
I don't feel impulsivity and changing my mind every three seconds. Helps me to save money and helps me to actually have procjets, to do them from the beginning to the end. As a creative person it helps me so much, even tho it's not perfect.

- Social life.
Impulsivity again. For the last year I avoided to plan to hang out with my Friends because my mind would change every hour. Not even joking. People couldn't count on me and it was tiring for everyone of us. Now, with my own limits of course, Can plan my weeks peacefully because it happens so little in comparison. 
I can answer DMs (it's not an invitation) and I can keep contact with most of my Friends. I used to not answer to anyone and be a Ghost for months. It Can still take me up to two weeks to respond but it's still a win.
I Can enjoy talking with people and not answer them to repeat themself because I'm *naturally* focused.

In conclusion, being medicated regularly, helped me overcome this feeling of sadness because now i feel, and I actually am, capable of doing things I love. I now I Can achieve whatever I want because I gained self-confidence and I can trust myself, which was impossible few months back. It's not Magic, but it changed for the better. It reduced my daily anxiety a lot (I don't really feel anxious anymore,even tho I suspect myself having chronic anxiety since I was a little kid, woaw), instead I feel ready to face everything, being negative or positive. You will discover your true self and invest your new-self into cool things. You will achieve new goals. And you're gonna be SO proud of yourself.

So please don't be discouraged because so many people are saying, ""Day one on meds! My life changed!"" That's not the case for everyone.

In my case, the meds make it more likely that I will adjust my habits -- in a realistic way-- and stick to them. A massive part of ADHD is an inability to manage ourselves the way we need to. 

Medicated, I will put myself to bed at a decent hour because I know how much better I function with enough sleep and the medication works better if I am well rested. 

Same for diet, I'm not over here making green goddess smoothies all day long. But it's simple and realistic. if I eat protein in the morning, I can tell myself my medication will help produce more neurotransmitters and I will feel better. 

If I remember to eat small amounts throughout the day, my moods will be more stable. Ditto if I stay hydrated. Etc. etc.

I think the ""magic"" of the meds is that they can make your brain more receptive to, and likely to follow these steps and routine to make life run more smoothly. These steps and similar, in turn, maximize how the meds work. I think it's cumulative and it takes minor tweaks not a massive life overhaul.

I don't like biting chunks of my lips out and now that it's winter and I don't have an effective moisturizer for my lips, there's so much crumbly flaky skin, and it's so easy to keep biting pieces off.

While I love to chew things, I am very conscious of my teeth, since I want to reduce cavities and damage as much as I can. Chewing gum doesn't work due to a TMJ issue.

I realize it's also dopamine seeking amongst other things.

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't know what to replace it with that can be an adequate replacement instead of a bad habit swap (don't want to chew on candy, or chips, eating carrots or celery too much hurts my tmj).

I've really tried a lot of things, and the most infuriating part of it is I would commit to not biting my lips and mouth and going full cold turkey only to find myself unconsciously doing it all over again.

&lt;p&gt;I got up from my PC and went to blow my nose and what felt like the first time; I heard the tissue crinkle as I scrunched it. I realised I was silent. No thoughts, just in that moment, it hit me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You go to the toilet to take a leak, you hear the stream. You aren’t humming to a song, keeping yourself busy, you’re still. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You think to yourself oh I need to do x,y,x tasks. So you do it. There’s no indecisiveness, you’re already in between doing the first task on the list and you realise you didn’t have to reason with yourself to do it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mid conversation you’re realising you don’t search for your words or a memory as much. You feel quicker, smarter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to a few weeks and all that anxiety you had about all the tasks that you should have done is not there. You’ve already done them. You’ve got extra headspace, you feel more rested. You start to feel better about yourself. &lt;/p&gt;

He is the owner of the pharmacy and he has never been out of my Adderall and Vyvanse, or my mom’s Ritalin and Vyvanse.","false","kcoyp5w","false","t1_kcnx2fg","3","ADHD","https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/18eedgq/cvs_refused_to_fill_adderall_because_its_on_a/kcoyp5w/","MouSe05","ADHD, with ADHD family","t2_96u9y","I mean, they're not perfect as in ""They have my script no matter what it is every single time"" but they are perfect in being consistent once the script is consistent if that makes sense. 

Example: Kids got diagnosed last summer. First script was unable to be filled on the day of, but 3 days later. A month later the med check confirmed their ""main"" doses but added a ""booster"" dose. The dose that was filled a month before was now filled immediately, but the boost dose was back ordered (XR vs IR and dose size here), and again got filled 3 days later. 1 month again, med check says all is well and start writing 90 day scripts. In GA we do 90 days in 3x30 and every one of those were filled without issue from that point forward.

Same thing happened to me with my psych, and when they switched from Addy to Vyvanse/Focalin and when I switched from Addy to Vyvanse to Focalin.

From my understanding they have to adhere to each state’s guidelines. 

For example Walgreens earlier this year said they would not stock or distribute the abortion pills in any locations in states they could face legal action against.

I would think that should be your legal responsibility before flat out refusing.

Benzo’s are another medication that pharmacists and certain docs have an issue prescribing, but what if you have a new patient who’s moved to the area that has been taking these meds for years? Suddenly stopping them will do a lot more harm to them than good.

A lot will say, they can take something else for anxiety, but they are often prescribed for other health things such as neurological issues, and unfortunately the benefits highly outweigh the side effects.

Another medication I also take is something that needs to be tapered down because of severe adverse effects if suddenly stopped. 

This is why a lot of the docs are pushing back on the strict DEA laws they are trying to put into place. It’s up to a doctor and a patient to decide what is better to deal with, and fully understand possible side effects.

I’m not sure how long you have been working, but we have some instances where you have a pharmacist who is maybe a year in making a judgement call over a doctor who has been in practice for 10-15 years.

Not trying to give you a hard time, but as a lot of MD’s have been saying with all of these changes, some people will end up dead as a consequence of getting their medications cut off.","false","t1_kco31am","t3_18eedgq",,"t2_fmqqq","I'm with you all the way.

I do my best to not ""punish patients"" even if they're rude, but I don't have enough time to even poop, let alone call on every script.

&lt;p&gt;And per the DEA admin as of mid July 2023 electronic rx can be transferred to a different pharmacy without having the prescriber send a whole new prescription (old rules). This is written out in a letter from Anne Milgram who&amp;#39;s the admin person at the DOJ. &lt;/p&gt;

Take your time with whatever situations presents you. 

As for picking which time to workout, it's all up to you. When morning is hard, aim for after work. But rule of thumb is, make sure yous eat something three hours before you workout. If not, protein shake hour before. I forgot to mention,  scheduling out your life will do wonders for you. Then chances are, you won't forget about eating. As for me, I'm intermittent fasting, and my schedule is eat a peanut butter sandwich at 12, and eat lunch between 3-4. Then when I get home, I relax for about 30 mins to hour, then force myself to go to the gym.  When I'm too tired, I take about 10-20min nap. This all came with discipline and obsession lol.

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Horse riding - I liked horses. Unfortunately, I have several lifelong injuries because of horses being spooked in the riding lesson arena, and then falling off. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I only did it from ages 9-11, so I wasn&amp;#39;t young enough to understand what I was risking. I&amp;#39;ll never go near a horse again - I&amp;#39;m not scared of them, I&amp;#39;m just not willing to risk sustaining another life-ruining injury. The worst was whiplash - I had to go to the hospital after getting thrown off the horse. My neck has never recovered, I cannot do any exercise that puts strain on the neck. Even with correct form, I cannot do sit-ups because it aggravates the injury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Running - I wanted to escape from my life. My home and constant exams at sixth form. I couldn&amp;#39;t escape either of them, obviously, but running helped me feel like I was escaping. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 2 years, I had ruined my ankles because no one ever taught me about running. No one in my family exercises, my parents are very abusive and neglectful - hence I&amp;#39;ve cut them out of my life now. So I didn&amp;#39;t know running in the cheap trainers I had would ruin my ankles. My parents would spend money on themselves but refuse to buy us kids decent clothing/shoes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zumba - I don&amp;#39;t think I ever actually enjoyed this much. But I was desperate - I was so miserable and lonely for so many years while at uni. I had no social interaction. So going to Zumba classes was the only option that worked for me - no one spoke to each other, but at least I could be physically near other humans. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All Zumba classes in my area shut down when the pandemic lockdowns started. All the ones I used to go to never opened again. My favourite instructor moved out of my city. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nowadays all I do is long walks. 2 hours a day or more, very brisk pace. It gets my heart rate up. I&amp;#39;m surprised by how fast I can comfortably walk, tbh. I get a little rush when I&amp;#39;m zooming past everyone that was in front of me, lol. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started going for long walks because I didn&amp;#39;t have anywhere else to go. I would be stuck inside alone all day if I didn&amp;#39;t go for walks (still alone). So it&amp;#39;s for mental health. I&amp;#39;ve been able to keep it up because if I don&amp;#39;t, I start getting suicidal. So it&amp;#39;s easy to be motivated for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;","1702169554","false","t3_18epvie","t3_18epvie",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"7","ADHD","t5_2qnwb","https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/18epvie/adhd_people_who_exercise_regularly_how/kcpiyz8/","altoidsjedi",,"t2_6f7v3","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This advice is not for everyone -- but getting a dog (and living alone / being where the &amp;quot;buck stops&amp;quot; in taking care of of a dog.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a period of time I got to spend living with someone who had a dog that showed me I had the temperament for being a halfway decent dog owner. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people simply are going to be bad dog owners, and should not get a dog. They&amp;#39;ll go in with the best of intentions, while hoping / expecting a dog to fix their life -- and they may find that they only end up neglecting the dog and themselves at the same time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It happens all the time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in my case, getting a dog placed a positive oppressive force in my life to get out the door and go on walks and runs everyday, no less than twice a day -- cause I simply cannot ignore my dogs puppy eyes begging for a walk, and cause I cannot live with poop and pee inside my house. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I didn&amp;#39;t do it, nobody else would -- the responsibility was solely on me, and it simply had to be done. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also need to keep a much cleaner place than I might otherwise, because if my dog eats or chews on anything he isn&amp;#39;t supposed to -- I&amp;#39;m gonna be stuck with the extreme guilt and extreme vet bill. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Easier for my adhd brain to take care of something else than take care of myself -- and it happens to be that taking care of the dog was taking care of me at the same time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It created a structure for me that my ADHD could no circumvent -- which means I&amp;#39;m now walking or running anywhere from 2-5 miles every day with my dog, and even in my worst and least productive days, getting fresh air, exercise, and a little bit of socialization with other people and dog owners. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, this is not advice everybody should follow -- if you don&amp;#39;t have a dog and are thinking of getting one, know that it&amp;#39;s an immense responsibility and even with the best of dogs, will create some serious limitations and obstacles in your life when you&amp;#39;re responsible for the physical and emotional well being of another living thing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you and a dog are the right fit for each other, it can potentially bring lots of positive structure to help manage the ADHD better, and lots of lovely memories, internal growth, and fuzzy warm feelings too&lt;/p&gt;

Exercise doesn’t fix everything…. But holy fuck does it fix me. Whenever I start feeling down I always ask myself if I have worked out, and gotten enough sleep. 

If the answer to either is no then it’s time to take care of myself and check back in once the answers are yes. 

I did that for so long that exercise became part of my ‘me time’ as in I need this time to function and survive. If I stop exercising it catches up to me quickly with anxiety that I can’t alleviate and then depression and generally discontented feelings.

&lt;p&gt;Dude, you&amp;#39;ve got ADHD. You LIVE ON TIMERS. You can&amp;#39;t remember more than one thing, and that thing that must be remembered is the timer. The mobile phone must have at least two timers apps and two reminder ones (one Google Calendar, the other your own whatsapp group for note taking, and that&amp;#39;s only because having a notes app would be too much and you generally do read the whatsapps).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then a paper notebook and pencil. And then a blackboard or whiteboard on one wall. Reminders are set fourfold. (To compensate for all the times you write something down to remember you must do X and then forget to read that list, so you also forget).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But... I feel you, but... why doesn&amp;#39;t your oven have an automatic timer? We need ADHD-friendly ovens that say &amp;quot;Dear Owner, this has been cooking for ten minutes already, do you remember you put something in here? Because if it&amp;#39;s a twelve-pound turkey, we&amp;#39;re OK, but if it&amp;#39;s a pizza, you might want to check up on it...&amp;quot; Apple iOven, ADHD-friendly...

Something like a quick ""I have a joke I wanted to tell"" or ""here's something I thought was interesting"". Giving them a point to latch onto early helps ground people. Even just saying ""im building up to something"" can help a lot.

Most speech and communication tips work a lot like essay writing. You make a claim or point, then follow it up with evidence. But if you don't know the point you're getting to, saying ""I'm trying to form this thought"" or something can help. A lot of the time people's frustration is tied into not knowing how they're supposed to emotionally react to the things you're saying. Giving them signposts like ""I thought it was funny that"" or ""I liked how x"" can help

Other tools include verbally allowing yourself to say things unpleasantly or bluntly- ""this is the inelegant way to say this"" when you don't know how to politely state a point, and trying to summarize what you just said after a minute or so. ""I feel"" statements are also very useful- ""im frustrated by this"" or ""I feel conflicted"" or ""im excited about x"".

Normally if people are having a conversation in good faith you don't have to justify the subject before introducing it. Like, you don't have to have a preamble on the benefits of having a pet when you're a kid trying to convince your parents you want a dog, its probably more effective to say ""I want a dog and this is why"". 

Perhaps try some of these tools when you get a chance- yeah it might feel like dumbing down the way you talk but giving people those verbal signposts to help them know how to react can be very helpful.","1702144406","false","kcnq66j","false","Joyju","t2_2dxtgq2t","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Best advice on this thread right here! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Context cues and how we communicate (I feel, etc.) are almost more important to be effective than what details we want to share. This is how you land the thoughts and stories where people don&amp;#39;t mind the details and length. This brings them along for the wild ride in your brain. And turns those details into bonding instead of criticism.&lt;/p&gt;

I think there's 4 things to remember with having ADHD &amp; work vs social contexts regarding conversations:

1. ADHD is not simply about attention, but rather is more about executive function. (Look up Dr Russell Barkley for info). 

2. Most of what we discuss at work is very close-ended so it's easy to figure what is asked and how answer it, while social discussions are more open-ended requiring more thought to put together a response. (Work: ""What is the status of the report you are working on? I believe you had a few more things to resolve with Joe. Have they been resolved?"" Vs. Social: ""How's it going?"")

3. People at work tend to care about the answers you give to their questions because they are interested in the topic (that's why they have this job) and it usually directly impacts their work. People in social situations often don't care much. This doesn't apply to close friends.

4. Making a story requires a lot of executive effort &amp; working memory because you have to keep track of (1) the point of your story, (2) what you have already said, (3) what you are currently saying, (4) how you are going to get to the point. Also, you have to pay attention to the audience's cues regarding interest level but something else in the environment is distracting you. Oh, and you are still telling your story, but somehow you're now on a completely different topic and you don't know where you went off topic so you backtrack as best you can and are now super self conscious about it, and you wrap up the story quickly.

What I've learned to work for me is using one of these 3 in social situations with acquaintances:
1. Give short, generic answers. (How's it going? I'm good, how are you?)
2. Prep some short answers to common questions/topics (eg questions: how's work? How's your wife? How's your family? How are your kids? Etc)
3. Just keep doing you and don't let the haters get to you.

Also, people love being asked questions so try to end your story with a question for the other person.","1702195845","kcqst5c","false","t3_18eholr",,"t2_bxziccae","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thing I just thought: Usually for work stuff, I tend to prep for meetings &amp;amp; write key points down, but most people rarely prep for social gatherings (at least in not the same way externally).&lt;/p&gt;

I have always loved talking in details and giving full context before telling someone anything sometimes I have these mini side stories as well. Other times I forget the main point.

My brother told me it's an annoying habit when you can't be straight to the point and give stories.

I don't know how to do this? I feel disconnected and fake if I just get to the point when I am talking to family and friends. Even if I try I feel like an imposter and just go silent 

I can easily cut to the chase when I am in professional settings.
