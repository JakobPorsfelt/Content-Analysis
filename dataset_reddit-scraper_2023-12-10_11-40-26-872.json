Having someone who knew the person well in childhood and was an adult at that time - like a parent - be able to speak to how the person acted during childhood is invaluable because they would have had first hand knowledge - as an adult - of that person’s external symptoms. A 20 year old (or even a 25 or 35 or 40 year old) may not have that great of a recollection of their possible symptoms during childhood, because they were a young child at the time. Understand?  \n\nBeyond input from a parent, it’s also helpful for a doctor to get information from childhood records such as report cards and teacher comments. For example, if a child did well in school but teachers regularly noted on report cards or in other notes that the person “frequently interrupted others” or “couldn’t sit still during class,” those are strong indicators that the person did experience adhd symptoms in childhood.",

That doesn&amp;#39;t mean when asked the correct questions about your childhood, and listening for clues, a psychiatrist wont see the symptoms reflected in their answers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I filled out a Vanderbilt assessment for my kids assessment. If I were to ask my mom to fill out that same assessment about me as a kid, I&amp;#39;m willing to bet her answers would indicate ADHD symptoms. Even though mine were completely missed as a child. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m still not a fan of the requirement for involving family in the diagnostic process, and I think providers need to have an alternative available.

Not sure of their exact reason of wanting to try different meds. If you are supposed to go off of them completely, or potentially add on a non-stimulant. \n\nIf you're not struggling with your current meds and feel as though your benefiting from them, I would definitely advocate for staying on them or at least getting a monthly supply of your medication prescribed as currently tailored until you can get a psychiatrist to take over for your mental health medication management.

  "text": "Hi People of reddit! I'm still new to posting, so please be gentle to me!   \nI (27F) and my partner (27M) have been together for almost 10 years. We met in Tafe (an optional Australian education between Highschool and University) and are getting married in 2025.  \nWe have had a few brief discussions about children and having a family.

I'm better then I used to be but a lot of that is to do with actually becoming aware of my ADHD last year.\n\nI can't give you a magic fix but what I can say is it helps a lot to accept the ways that ADHD holds you back and define what success is relative to YOU, it's super unhealthy to define success based on what it is to others because we're not like others.\n\nThis is tough when you live in a world that's built to try be \"one size fits all\" and you really don't fit.\n\nBut if I could tell my past self anything it would be that it's ok to take things a bit more slowly then others. Like if you're doing a 4 year degree and struggling to handle the workload then maybe consider studying part-time and do it in 6 years or something.\n\nI dropped out of what I was studying because I couldn't cope with the pace but I badly wish I had just accepted that I was a bit much for me and just spaced everything out. I could have done that, it might have cost a bit more but at least I might have gotten the qualification to show for it.\n\nOnce I started accepting that I'm not lazy, useless, generally crap and started looking at how I could adjust my life to fit around my ADHD I started to be a lot happier.\n\nOn the subject of Minecraft, buddy they ruined it back in 2016 with the \"Combat Update\". That's when they started to transition the game away from being this chill, meditative experience to something more mainstream and stressful. I got used to it sorta but last time I played was the first time I played with those damn flying enemies that spawn at night and those things are a deal-breaker.\n\nThey're far too common and you just can't relax when they're around and you can't really fight them until they finally make the decision to swoop so they just drive me nuts.\n\nAlso the Nether is just crazy now. I never played Minecraft for challenging combat and crap like that, I play it for relaxing, exploring, building. Just drifting off in the simplicity of it.\n\nI would get satisfaction out of building stuff out of stone brick but never touching creative mode. So I would build something decent and then when you tell people \"by the way I didn't use creative mode\" it's a bit more impressive then what crazy kids get up to with mods and madness. Stone Brick takes some work.\n\nGetting something to watch up on my second screen and then just zoning out a bit while I try and strip mine a mountain or something. Nice and relaxing.\n\nI also like to build nether portals as a form of fast transport to get around in the normal world so I would sometimes spend a dumb amount of time building roads in the nether to connect distant portals.\n\nIn summary, you gotta define what success looks like to you. You'll never go to the gym if you're constantly beating yourself up because you don't go at 7am and got nuts for hours. If you can get yourself from nothing to 5 minutes a day on an exercise bike or something then you DID IT. THAT'S SUCCESS FOR YOU. Maybe not for others but you're not them you're YOU!

A lot of us feel that way at times, when our brains let us down. But it doesn’t make it true. It sounds like you’ve been through a lot and people in your life have let you down. You haven’t had the support or opportunities you deserved. But your life isn’t wasted — just you going to your classes proves that. And I doubt people there think you’re stupid. The other students didn’t finish their educations in the traditional way, either. But everybody is showing up and trying. And the teachers have chosen to work with y’all — so they shouldn’t think you’re stupid either; they probably know you just did a couple of your life steps in a different order from most people.\n\nEducation and intelligence are not the same thing. My great-grandfather was an incredibly smart man who only went to school for a few years. Most people alive today aren’t that far removed from our ancestors who would’ve had little, if any, formal schooling. Education was optional in the US until 1930. It didn’t make our grandparents and their parents (and all the generations before them) stupid. It made them people who did the best they could with the opportunities they were given. Just like you are.\n\nI think a lot about this Maya Angelou quote: “I did then what I knew how to do. Now that I know better, I do better.” It’s helped me forgive my past self for her mistakes. That past version of me was doing her best, even if she made a lot of mistakes and caused me a lot of problems in the present.\n\nYou’re doing your best, and that’s what matters. This is a great place to find strategies for managing your ADHD, too. You said you struggle to focus on anything at all — if you can give some examples, people will probably have some ideas that might help!\n\nI know you can’t see it right now, but you deserve to be proud of yourself.

In my world, my perfect standardized test scores were impressive. At Ivy Leagues, everybody has perfect standardized test scores. They have graduating classes of around about 7,000. The average IQ there is 140. Their normal is our 1 in 250. Their 1 in 250 have an IQ of 180. Their 1 in 1000 have an IQ of 185. Our general population 1 in 1000 have an IQ of 145.

      "body": "I also was diagnosed at 21 and I think my intelligence and ability to skate by on paper is why my ADHD was undiagnosed for so long. It’s also why my life is currently a mess from being unable to properly cope with it outside of an academic setting as an adult. I also feel angry about the potential I had of doing more with my intelligence had i been diagnosed earlier. I dropped out of college at 19 due to covid and things going online, for me it was impossible to do well with that going on especially being unmedicated back then. I still haven’t gone back and I feel angry looking back on how I could’ve handled a lot of situations like that better in my life had I been diagnosed earlier. But my intelligence is why I was able to mask it so well and fly under the radar.\n\nGrowing up I simply was a very good test taker and I can pick up on things very quick when it’s crunch time but otherwise my intelligence is kind of useless to me. I would barely ever do my homework but I would get 90-100% on tests while barely paying attention in class (maladaptive daydreaming, and then just skipping when I got older) so I was never failing my classes despite having shit attendance and having tons of zeros in homework/project categories. I would skate by with mostly Bs in the end, but it makes me mad that I could’ve excelled and gotten into a much better college then I did and life would be much different for me had I been diagnosed sooner. I got into an okay university and went for one year before dropping out. \n\nThen university somewhat reinforced my bad adhd habits. I still did great on exams despite barely showing up to my classes and now they were worth a bigger % of the grade. So I did better on paper in university but still had such bad habits that were kinda being rewarded. Once covid hit though it switched to the exams being worth less and more of a project/attendance emphasis since it’s easier to cheat from home. Executive dysfunction + online class = my grades tanking and me dropping out. I wanna go back eventually but I’m still picking up the pieces from the financial decisions I had to make as a result of dropping out so idk. Kind of why I’m a tad bitter still about not being diagnosed sooner, but I am medicated now and getting my life back on track. \n\nI really resonate with feeling like an imposter because people in school would be like “I had to study all night for this exam” and I would just show up and do the same or better than them. Or I would BS my way through essays the last minute and usually get an A while others would put in time and get a B. But if you’re still in university, I have to warn you and say you might be in for a rude awakening like I was about how bad your ADHD symptoms are when it comes to other adult responsibilities in the future. I live alone now and whew, BSing my way through school was certainly easier than managing all my current responsibilities w/adhd. My life quickly became a mess and it’s what pushed me to get a diagnosis. \n\n**Sorry this is long as fuck, i really resonate and i saw this post shortly after smoking so I was hyper focused AF**",

I'm 24 and man, it was SO hard to discover that I could have really achieved my goals, as in school or daily life because i had to give them up against my will, and this feeling of extreme sadness didn't leave me until few weeks, had been there for solid 4 years.\n\nIt was this summer, now I have a proper medication with a professional following me since less than a month. And I feel so self-confident. Because I can achieve my goals at work (temporary one), everyone can have confidence towards me and can count on me. I don't feel out of place anymore, and we all have sympathy for each other. For daily life, I would say there are two thing:\n\n- Daily tasks, and adulthood. \nI Can have all my papers done when it has to be. Saving me money for some, and a huge amount of anxiety overall. For example, I have to change my identity papers because I'm transgender: It took me 3 weeks to get an appointment and all of my folder done, in reality I had to do it for 3 years now. It still get me in trouble today, because people think it's not me on my papers.\nI can clean. Before I had to just cry alone in my apartment because it was so dirty and shameful. Now I don't even think about it, i just do the chores. It helps me to be in a better mindset. Clean Space = positive mind. It also saves me money because the dishes don't stay for months (3 or 4) in the sink while I ignored it. I don't use take away anymore.\nI don't feel impulsivity and changing my mind every three seconds. Helps me to save money and helps me to actually have procjets, to do them from the beginning to the end. As a creative person it helps me so much, even tho it's not perfect.\n\n- Social life.\nImpulsivity again. For the last year I avoided to plan to hang out with my Friends because my mind would change every hour. Not even joking. People couldn't count on me and it was tiring for everyone of us. Now, with my own limits of course, Can plan my weeks peacefully because it happens so little in comparison. \nI can answer DMs (it's not an invitation) and I can keep contact with most of my Friends. I used to not answer to anyone and be a Ghost for months. It Can still take me up to two weeks to respond but it's still a win.\nI Can enjoy talking with people and not answer them to repeat themself because I'm *naturally* focused.\n\nIn conclusion, being medicated regularly, helped me overcome this feeling of sadness because now i feel, and I actually am, capable of doing things I love. I now I Can achieve whatever I want because I gained self-confidence and I can trust myself, which was impossible few months back. It's not Magic, but it changed for the better. It reduced my daily anxiety a lot (I don't really feel anxious anymore,even tho I suspect myself having chronic anxiety since I was a little kid, woaw), instead I feel ready to face everything, being negative or positive. You will discover your true self and invest your new-self into cool things. You will achieve new goals. And you're gonna be SO proud of yourself.\n\nBe patient. You got this. :)",

(And congrats on diagnosis and medication!!)\n\nI feel like for me (diagnosed as an adult), I have one of the classic stories of, I can now very clearly see what was going on with me as a kid but at the time, the adults in my life (not their fault, just the time) I think just saw me as flaky and not fulfilling my potential. So I do kinda grieve how a number of years of my life might have been different if I hadn’t internalized feelings that I just plain suck, am lazy and ungrateful, etc.\n\nI also feel badly for my mom who hasn’t officially been diagnosed, but who I am now very confident is ADHD. My mom in the past had been real weird about me being in therapy for depression so when I got diagnosed with ADHD, I didn’t want to tell her and avoided it for quite a while. But I also didn’t know my sister had been diagnosed and my family rarely gets together.

It makes perfect sense to me now that she would be, but where I was diagnosed and got some answers far enough into adulthood that it feels late to me … my mom had a whole extra generation’s length to be internalizing negative thoughts about herself and it is just now dawning on her that there’s a very legitimate reason.\n\nI digress, but solidarity and glad you’re now feeling as good as you should have felt for a long time!",
      "bodyHTML": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Totally get this!! (And congrats on diagnosis and medication!!)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel like for me (diagnosed as an adult), I have one of the classic stories of, I can now very clearly see what was going on with me as a kid but at the time, the adults in my life (not their fault, just the time) I think just saw me as flaky and not fulfilling my potential. So I do kinda grieve how a number of years of my life might have been different if I hadn’t internalized feelings that I just plain suck, am lazy and ungrateful, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also feel badly for my mom who hasn’t officially been diagnosed, but who I am now very confident is ADHD. My mom in the past had been real weird about me being in therapy for depression so when I got diagnosed with ADHD, I didn’t want to tell her and avoided it for quite a while. But I also didn’t know my sister had been diagnosed and my family rarely gets together.

Unfortunately, I have several lifelong injuries because of horses being spooked in the riding lesson arena, and then falling off. \n\nI only did it from ages 9-11, so I wasn't young enough to understand what I was risking. I'll never go near a horse again - I'm not scared of them, I'm just not willing to risk sustaining another life-ruining injury. The worst was whiplash - I had to go to the hospital after getting thrown off the horse. My neck has never recovered, I cannot do any exercise that puts strain on the neck. Even with correct form, I cannot do sit-ups because it aggravates the injury.\n\n2. Running - I wanted to escape from my life. My home and constant exams at sixth form. I couldn't escape either of them, obviously, but running helped me feel like I was escaping. \n\nAfter 2 years, I had ruined my ankles because no one ever taught me about running. No one in my family exercises, my parents are very abusive and neglectful - hence I've cut them out of my life now. So I didn't know running in the cheap trainers I had would ruin my ankles. My parents would spend money on themselves but refuse to buy us kids decent clothing/shoes. \n\n3. Zumba - I don't think I ever actually enjoyed this much. But I was desperate - I was so miserable and lonely for so many years while at uni. I had no social interaction. So going to Zumba classes was the only option that worked for me - no one spoke to each other, but at least I could be physically near other humans. \n\nAll Zumba classes in my area shut down when the pandemic lockdowns started. All the ones I used to go to never opened again. My favourite instructor moved out of my city. \n\n4. Nowadays all I do is long walks. 2 hours a day or more, very brisk pace. It gets my heart rate up. I'm surprised by how fast I can comfortably walk, tbh. I get a little rush when I'm zooming past everyone that was in front of me, lol. \n\nI started going for long walks because I didn't have anywhere else to go. I would be stuck inside alone all day if I didn't go for walks (still alone). So it's for mental health. I've been able to keep it up because if I don't, I start getting suicidal.

I get a little rush when I&amp;#39;m zooming past everyone that was in front of me, lol. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started going for long walks because I didn&amp;#39;t have anywhere else to go. I would be stuck inside alone all day if I didn&amp;#39;t go for walks (still alone). So it&amp;#39;s for mental health. I&amp;#39;ve been able to keep it up because if I don&amp;#39;t, I start getting suicidal. So it&amp;#39;s easy to be motivated for that.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Covid happened and I saw myself gaining weight, I saw the person I could become in a photo and I have no idea how, but I was just able to commit myself to going to running at first. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I lost some weight and wanted to build muscle so I was in the gym lifting weights, running once or twice a week. I honestly have no idea how I maintain it. I’m not always consistent but I am more or less consistent every week. It surprises me, because I think I’m so inconsistent with almost everything else in my life. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think my body and brain just know, that this is good for me and so I must do it or I’ll feel worse. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;FYI I was diagnosed 3 weeks ago with ADHD at 31. I have an appointment at the end of this month to start with medication.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I don’t want to invest what little time I have in it. \n\nRecently though I started doing these boxing and combat classes on the VR and it’s actually really awesome. Ive realized there’s several reasons this is working for me when nothing else has: \n\n1) I’ve tried doing video classes before but because I’m in terrible shape I would always find it too hard and just quit after a couple of minutes. But these boxing classes aren’t hard, like I still work up a sweat but that’s only after going at it for awhile. By the time I’m struggling I’m almost done so I might as well finish the class. \n\nThere’s dance and fitness classes in the same all too but I’m too uncoordinated and out of shape for them, but boxing and combat are perfect for me. \n\n2) it’s actually really fun. Like feels like a game instead of a workout. So I actually WANT to do it. And I realized how ADHD perfect it is, because with every single hit you punch through a little ball that explodes and it’s like a super satisfying dopamine trigger every time. \n\n3) It keeps track of streaks. Both in the class itself- like how many cues you hit without missing, but also daily and weekly streaks. This is super motivating for me. It makes me go “Oh if I don’t get a class in before midnight I’ll lose my streak.” If I’m not feeling up to it, I can choose an easy short 6 minute class just to “keep the streak” going which is important because it keeps me coming back the next day instead of losing the streak and abandoning the habit altogether. I’m currently sick and have fallen out of doing it daily and I’m worried I won’t get back into it, but I legit want to, and it helps that I get emails about new classes, so I don’t completely forget about it. \n\nI’m not exactly getting super fit from a class or two a day but I feel like it’s a step in the right direction anyway so I’m pretty into it.",

I even created a spotify playlist of songs that have the perfect BPM to match my running pace, which makes it almost meditative when I get out there and run to the beat.\n- **Go opportunistically**, don't wait for the perfect time: Sure maybe it would be better to go tomorrow when I have more time, or later on today right before I already planned to shower, etc. But we all know that \"later\" never comes. So if the mood strikes you, just go, don't let yourself reason yourself out of it.\n- **Remember that transitions are the enemy**, so try to make them easier: Lay your running gear out before bed so that it's ready to go first thing in the morning. When you finish work, go exercise immediately, ***don't sit down!!!***. Find ways to reduce the effort needed to transition into exercise.\n- **Pick the most enjoyable form** even if it's not the \"best\": In an ideal world we'd all be doing a variety of cardio, weights, core exercises, etc etc. But if you don't enjoy those things and it becomes a chore then you'll never stick with it. Doing something is better than doing nothing. If you love to run, love to swim, love yoga, love the driving range, whatever it is, then just do that. As long as you're not risking injury, there's nothing wrong with just doing one type of exercise.\n- **Set goals**: To help with motivation, set a distance goal, a time goal, a weight goal, whatever it is that will excite you and get you out there.\n- **Gamification**: Again, motivation and fun. There are lots of apps and stuff out there. The one that has really been working for me lately is https://wandrer.earth. You connect it to your strava and it maps everywhere you've ever run (or ridden) and then you can try to run down every street in an area. Having a mission makes me way more likely to get out there.\n- **Train with someone else**: I'm most likely to go if I don't have a choice in the matter. If it's just me, then I can decide not to go. If I've made a commitment to another person or group of people, then I just have to go, no two ways about it. When I've been at my fittest is when I was part of a local footy club and training/playing several times a week, no excuses. It also makes it more fun being a social thing, if you're into that.",

When you finish work, go exercise immediately, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;don&amp;#39;t sit down!!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Find ways to reduce the effort needed to transition into exercise.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pick the most enjoyable form&lt;/strong&gt; even if it&amp;#39;s not the &amp;quot;best&amp;quot;: In an ideal world we&amp;#39;d all be doing a variety of cardio, weights, core exercises, etc etc. But if you don&amp;#39;t enjoy those things and it becomes a chore then you&amp;#39;ll never stick with it. Doing something is better than doing nothing. If you love to run, love to swim, love yoga, love the driving range, whatever it is, then just do that. As long as you&amp;#39;re not risking injury, there&amp;#39;s nothing wrong with just doing one type of exercise.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set goals&lt;/strong&gt;: To help with motivation, set a distance goal, a time goal, a weight goal, whatever it is that will excite you and get you out there.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gamification&lt;/strong&gt;: Again, motivation and fun. There are lots of apps and stuff out there. The one that has really been working for me lately is &lt;a href=\"https://wandrer.earth\"&gt;https://wandrer.earth&lt;/a&gt;. You connect it to your strava and it maps everywhere you&amp;#39;ve ever run (or ridden) and then you can try to run down every street in an area. Having a mission makes me way more likely to get out there.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Train with someone else&lt;/strong&gt;: I&amp;#39;m most likely to go if I don&amp;#39;t have a choice in the matter. If it&amp;#39;s just me, then I can decide not to go. If I&amp;#39;ve made a commitment to another person or group of people, then I just have to go, no two ways about it. When I&amp;#39;ve been at my fittest is when I was part of a local footy club and training/playing several times a week, no excuses. It also makes it more fun being a social thing, if you&amp;#39;re into that.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

      "body": "I set an alarm in the morning for an hour before I plan on actually getting up. I make sure it’s a very distinct and recognizable sound that I won’t mistake for my normal alarm in my sleep. When that alarm goes off, I take my 10mg Ritalin XR pill, which I put in a pill box in my bedside table the night before, then go back to sleep until my actual alarm goes off. At that point the Ritalin is starting to take effect and I feel much more clear headed and alert. I still scroll on my phone for 5 minutes, but then I do get up. Once up, I feed my pets and make myself a latte and high protein breakfast. It’s often something easy like a high protein yogurt with granola and chocolate chips, but sometimes I also make hot food like eggs or tofu scramble. While I eat, I turn on the tv and stare mindlessly at my phone. After breakfast, I take my dogs on a 15-30 minute walk (depending on the weather and how much I have in my work day ahead of me). Getting outside is super helpful for circadian rhythms and it also is my final “pep” up before my workout. Once I’m back inside, I put on a sports bra and work out in that and my pajama pants and sneakers. I follow a 20 minute HIIT/plyometrics video. Sometimes I’m into it. Sometimes it sucks. But you can do anything for 20 minutes. And a half assed workout is better than no workout at all. I like following Sean T’s workouts on Beachbody. He’s super motivational! I’m doing his transform 20 videos now. They are great for people of multiple fitness levels. Once my workout is finished, I have a Ketochow protein smoothie (which taste amazing and are honestly a treat. I love the snickerdoodle flavor) and ice my knees while staring at my phone for 15 minutes. Then I clean up a bit, shower, and get ready to leave for work. \n\nThat routine is something that I established this year. I’ve also lost 10 lbs. since the beginning of the year. I found the best thing to do to establish the new routine was to do it during more “reasonable” hours on days when I wasn’t working first. I made it a mission to reflect on what was working for me and what wasn’t in order to really refine things. Then, once I had the routine down, I gradually moved it to in front of my work day by adding one new element of the routine every day until I had the whole thing and I was also gradually waking up earlier each day too. So on work days now that routine looks like—&gt; 330am take meds; 425am wake up and stare at phone; 430-510am feed pets and myself; 510-540am walk dogs; 540-610am workout (including stretching after); 610-625am ice and ketochow; 625-640am cleaning chores; 640-725am shower and get ready; 725am leave for work…. When I was establishing this routine over the weekends initially, my starting time was 3 hours ahead of what I just listed for everything. Having this routine has honestly changed my life in such a positive way. I’ve tried adding in even more things because it’s exciting when things are working well but honestly just had to accept that I can’t pack anything else into my morning. Sometimes you just have to accept that good IS good enough - which can be hard for the adhd brain.",
      "bodyHTML": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I set an alarm in the morning for an hour before I plan on actually getting up. I make sure it’s a very distinct and recognizable sound that I won’t mistake for my normal alarm in my sleep. When that alarm goes off, I take my 10mg Ritalin XR pill, which I put in a pill box in my bedside table the night before, then go back to sleep until my actual alarm goes off. At that point the Ritalin is starting to take effect and I feel much more clear headed and alert. I still scroll on my phone for 5 minutes, but then I do get up. Once up, I feed my pets and make myself a latte and high protein breakfast. It’s often something easy like a high protein yogurt with granola and chocolate chips, but sometimes I also make hot food like eggs or tofu scramble. While I eat, I turn on the tv and stare mindlessly at my phone. After breakfast, I take my dogs on a 15-30 minute walk (depending on the weather and how much I have in my work day ahead of me). Getting outside is super helpful for circadian rhythms and it also is my final “pep” up before my workout. Once I’m back inside, I put on a sports bra and work out in that and my pajama pants and sneakers. I follow a 20 minute HIIT/plyometrics video. Sometimes I’m into it. Sometimes it sucks. But you can do anything for 20 minutes. And a half assed workout is better than no workout at all. I like following Sean T’s workouts on Beachbody. He’s super motivational! I’m doing his transform 20 videos now. They are great for people of multiple fitness levels. Once my workout is finished, I have a Ketochow protein smoothie (which taste amazing and are honestly a treat. I love the snickerdoodle flavor) and ice my knees while staring at my phone for 15 minutes. Then I clean up a bit, shower, and get ready to leave for work. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That routine is something that I established this year. I’ve also lost 10 lbs. since the beginning of the year. I found the best thing to do to establish the new routine was to do it during more “reasonable” hours on days when I wasn’t working first. I made it a mission to reflect on what was working for me and what wasn’t in order to really refine things. Then, once I had the routine down, I gradually moved it to in front of my work day by adding one new element of the routine every day until I had the whole thing and I was also gradually waking up earlier each day too. So on work days now that routine looks like—&amp;gt; 330am take meds; 425am wake up and stare at phone; 430-510am feed pets and myself; 510-540am walk dogs; 540-610am workout (including stretching after); 610-625am ice and ketochow; 625-640am cleaning chores; 640-725am shower and get ready; 725am leave for work…. When I was establishing this routine over the weekends initially, my starting time was 3 hours ahead of what I just listed for everything. Having this routine has honestly changed my life in such a positive way. I’ve tried adding in even more things because it’s exciting when things are working well but honestly just had to accept that I can’t pack anything else into my morning.

Although I cannot remember not to do this, I have successfully, mostly, managed to keep a cup of water in the microwave at all times, because of this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alternate story ending III: I set the timer, correctly, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; respond when it goes off (because I &lt;em&gt;didn&amp;#39;t&lt;/em&gt; run outside &amp;quot;for just a minute, or start vacuuming, or start some other activity that would prevent me from hearing the timer), but when I go to check, the food needs &lt;em&gt;just two more minutes&lt;/em&gt;.  Dear reader, I leave it to you to guess how that turns out.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

      "body": "Hi blackpearl!\n\nI think there's 4 things to remember with having ADHD &amp; work vs social contexts regarding conversations:\n\n1. ADHD is not simply about attention, but rather is more about executive function. (Look up Dr Russell Barkley for info). \n\n2. Most of what we discuss at work is very close-ended so it's easy to figure what is asked and how answer it, while social discussions are more open-ended requiring more thought to put together a response. (Work: \"What is the status of the report you are working on? I believe you had a few more things to resolve with Joe. Have they been resolved?\" Vs. Social: \"How's it going?\")\n\n3. People at work tend to care about the answers you give to their questions because they are interested in the topic (that's why they have this job) and it usually directly impacts their work. People in social situations often don't care much. This doesn't apply to close friends.\n\n4. Making a story requires a lot of executive effort &amp; working memory because you have to keep track of (1) the point of your story, (2) what you have already said, (3) what you are currently saying, (4) how you are going to get to the point. Also, you have to pay attention to the audience's cues regarding interest level but something else in the environment is distracting you. Oh, and you are still telling your story, but somehow you're now on a completely different topic and you don't know where you went off topic so you backtrack as best you can and are now super self conscious about it, and you wrap up the story quickly.\n\nWhat I've learned to work for me is using one of these 3 in social situations with acquaintances:\n1. Give short, generic answers. (How's it going? I'm good, how are you?)\n2. Prep some short answers to common questions/topics (eg questions: how's work? How's your wife? How's your family? How are your kids? Etc)\n3. Just keep doing you and don't let the haters get to you.\n\nAlso, people love being asked questions so try to end your story with a question for the other person.",
