"I just got my Master's degree this week. This year was tough, especially with one of my parents passing away right in the middle of the term, which led to a battle with depression. There were moments when I seriously considered dropping out and almost didn't complete my dissertation. I knew I could've done way better in usual circumstances, but at least I made it to the finish line.","ADHD","r/ADHD","2023-12-02T12:00:25.000Z","comment",,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just got my Master&amp;#39;s degree this week.
